This project involves developing a Q&A system designed to provide seamless, book-based answers to complex user queries. The system utilizes the book "Hubble Focus: The Dark Universe," a downloadable e-book from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. Here's a sneak peek into the key components of this project:

üîç TransformQueryEngine by LlamaIndex: This powerhouse enables advanced query transformation, ensuring that even the most intricate questions are handled with precision.

‚ö° Groq + Llama3: Leveraging a fast and powerful LLM endpoint, responses are generated swiftly and effectively, elevating the user experience.

üß† Qdrant Integration: A robust solution for managing and retrieving relevant data, ensuring that answers are not just accurate but also contextually relevant.

This system is designed to synthesize information from various sources, providing users with thorough and well-rounded responses. Whether it's for academic research, professional inquiries, or just satisfying one‚Äôs curiosity, this Q&A system can change the way we seek answers to questions.
